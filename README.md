# JavaScript Fundamentals Practice: Core Concepts and Logic

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of solution sets and practice exercises designed to reinforce foundational knowledge in **JavaScript (ES6+)**. The structure is organized thematically to provide a clear, easy-to-review resource for core programming concepts and language syntax, primarily aligning with industry-standard practices and educational curricula.

The objective of this practice series is to demonstrate proficiency in basic data manipulation, control flow, and modular code organization.

## Key Technical Domains

The solutions within this repository cover and validate competence in the following fundamental areas:

| Technical Area | Specific Concepts Addressed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Control Flow** | Conditional Logic (`if/else`, `switch`), Loop Constructs (`for`, `while`), and Iteration Techniques. |
| **Data Types and Variables** | Primitive and Reference Types, Type Coercion, Scope, and Variable Declaration (`var`, `let`, `const`). |
| **Arrays and Collections** | Array Manipulation, Multidimensional Arrays, and Iterative Methods. |
| **Functions** | Function Definition, Parameters, Return Values, Scope, and Function as a First-Class Citizen. |
| **Objects & Classes** | Object Properties and Methods, Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and Class Syntax. |
| **String Manipulation** | Text Processing, String Methods, and Regular Expressions (Regex). |

## Repository Structure and Organization

The code is organized by technical domain to facilitate targeted review. Each domain is represented by a dedicated directory or set of files:

* `/basic-syntax/`
* `/data-types-and-variables/`
* `/arrays-and-loops/`
* `/functions/`
* `/object-and-classes/`
* `/text-processing/`

## Local Setup and Execution

To clone this repository and execute the solutions locally, a **Node.js environment** is required.
